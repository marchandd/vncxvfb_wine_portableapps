### Command line explanation

All details on [docs](https://github.com/marchandd/vncxvfb_wine_portableapps/blob/master/docs/summary.md "Summary")

3 methods to find password:

- Search password value into build.log file from marchandd/vncxvfb_wine_portableapps image to access later to container.

- If you don't have build image with log file redirection, use this comand:  
:computer: `docker inspect IMAGEID`

- If you don't have password value, enter directly into container to find log inside with [Nsenter](http://itsagooddaytobegeek.com/docker-ep-02-installation-de-nsenter/ "Nsenter")

### Firewall

:warning: If your Firewall is enabled on the host, with default outgoing policy turned to 
deny, 
you will have to disable 5900 port filtering:
- Make a new rule for VNC (5900/TCP) to enable outgoing policy.

## Build container

:computer: `docker run -d -p 127.0.0.1:XXXXX:5900 marchandd/vncxvfb_wine_firefox`
